# This is a solution of this challange => [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

- First of all, I gave the whole section 100% of viewport height and background to light blue.
- For this challange I used FlexBox for centering a card.
- Then, I also make Flex container card and gave direction to column.
- Also I gave some padding to card, make it blue and give it shadows as it is in the design.
- Then, give some styles to the title and margins from top and bottom.
- After this I created another div element for data and put price and deadline in it. Also, I give this div element display: flex and justify content: space-between.
- In the price and deadline div elements I put images and make those divs flex containers. also align them on the same line.
- I gave some padding bottom to this div and make a border bottom because there is a bottom border in the design too.
- Lastly, I also created another div element where I put user name and photo. I give them flexibility option too.
- Because of the name is different from the text before, I put it in tha span tag and give a different style to it.
